# simple-tts-robot
A lightweight Linux text-to-speech (TTS) simulator that generates a slow, robotic, echoing voice effect using espeak and sox. Easy shell scripts with customizable pitch and reverberation. Fully open source. On macOS, some commands may require sudo due to system restrictions; Linux usually doesnâ€™t.
